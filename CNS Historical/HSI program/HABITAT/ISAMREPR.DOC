                    ISAMREPR Repair Utility

The Microsoft ISAM package includes the ISAMREPR.exe utility to
help recover databases that become corrupted. ISAMREPR can only
restore physical integrity to a database (i.e., consistency
among the tables in the database). ISAM does not pre-image
changes made in a database and write them to a temporary file.
Therefore, it is not possible to restore individual records
entered if a crash occurs between the time a record is entered
in the table and the next physical disk write. (When data is
entered into an .rdf database, the data is written directly to
disk when the <F2> SAVE command is issued. The most data that
can be lost from a power outage is the record currently being
entered.) 

When ISAMREPR restores the database, it systematically goes
through every table and index and recreates the database, using
every piece of internally consistent information in the file.
If anything is found that cannot be reconciled with the other
information in the file, it is deleted. This restores
consistency to the database. It is possible that some blocks of
data will never be reconciled with the database and will
therefore be lost.

The synatx for ISAMREPR is as follows:

        isamrepr databasename.rdf <enter>

The databasename is the filename of the database you need to
repair. ISAMREPR restores physical integrity to the database and
prints messages to the screen whenever it takes any action that
results in the loss of data. The messages describe the types of
problems that were discovered and corrected. You can redirect
this output to a file or to the printer using the DOS
redirection operator (">"). The messages that may appear are
included in the following table:

Message:    Table was truncated; data lost
    During structural analysis of the table's pages, an inconsistent
    page caused the table to be truncated as of the last uncorrupted
    page. This message is only given once for any affected table. 

Message:    One or more records were deleted.
    One of ISAM's internal tables was found to have inconsistent
    data. 

Message:    Cannot repair <name>: Not a database file
    Repair process has been aborted because the file was not
    recognisable as a database.

Message:    Cannot repair database:  Uncorrectable problems
    Repair process has been aborted because the database cannot be
    repaired. Some common reasons include: system tables not found
    in the expected location; any of the system tables is
    structually inconsistent, etc

Message:    Repair of <name> completed successfully.
    Repair process completed.

A repair may also be aborted for reasons having nothing to do
with the state of the database. Messages resulting from such
cases include (but are not limited to): Disk Full, Out of
Memory, File Not Found.

When you use the ISAMREPR utility it requires additional space
within your database to accomplish its work. This adds at least
32k to the size of the database. Do not run the utility if your
disk does not have this amount of space available in the current
working directory.
